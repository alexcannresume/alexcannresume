Welcome.

This is the GitHub account I have created so that I can share my private repositories for my resume.
This account does not have any repositories itself, but all of my private repositories from my
personal account are shared with this account. My private account's name is agcann17. To view the
repositories, simply go to https://github.com/agcann17 or search for the page using the username
agcann17. All private repositories should now be visable.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding looking at my code.
