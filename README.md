Welcome.

This is the GitHub account I have created so that I can share my private repositories for my resume.
This account does not have any repositories itself, but all private agcann17 repositories are shared 
with it. To view the repositories, they should be on the left side when on the home screen. Or, 
the repositories should be visible now when accessing my github account, agcann17, page by searching 
the username. 

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding looking at my code.
