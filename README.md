Welcome.

This is the GitHub account I have created so that I can share my private repositories for my resume.
This account does not have any repositories itself, but all of my private repositories from my
personal account are shared. The account name is agcann17. To view the repositories, return to the home 
screen by pressing the CatIcon in the top left and they should be listed on the right. Additionally, 
the repositories should be visible now when accessing my personal github account, agcann17, page by searching 
the username. 

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding looking at my code.
